(7) Who am I to state who starts?
(9) Desire, prestige: entwining flirts
(7) On first, on third, players play
(9) Batting 1000 keeps fear at bay?

(30)
(7) Who am I as time's like darts?
(7) When Moving forward sometimes hurts.
(7) On and on; day-to-day
(9) The balm will place, and heartache allay

(32)
(7) Who am I with rhyme so terse?
(9) First written to page, constrained in verse
(6) Now resonates in plain
(10) Next to be trashed-- releagted in vain?

(30)
(9) Who am I with thine hunger and thirst?
(9) Sewing thread of dreams; a purpose coerce
(6) Stitched ever so slightly,
(6) over time sinched tightly.

(32)
(9) For I am I, but a life in flight
(9) Working day's-end by moon and night light
(7) On and on; and yet to say:
(8) Wisdom imparts; perchance to stay



# Chorus
```

(4) From dawn to yawn
(1) and
(3) Coast to coast
(4) We do not boast
(6) Since some have it harder,
(6) While others get farther

(9) Who am I with thine hunger and thirst?
(9) A soul in tryst: thee purpose coerce
(9) When placed in lush gardens of dreams
(9) To frolic and play, perchance to stay





(10) Can a song made up of minutes long

laid plain
A soul in tryst
